# Digital Tribes - Ad-Hoc Mesh Network
Ad-Hoc Mesh Network using Raspberry Pi's for the Digital Tribes Hardware Challenge / Hackathon and is achieved by implementing [B.A.T.M.A.N-ADV](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki) and/or [HSMM-Pi](https://github.com/urlgrey/hsmm-pi/blob/master/README.md).

## Challenge 2: Can you design a prototype which operates in an ad hoc network suited for distributed safety devices?
